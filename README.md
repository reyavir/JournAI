JournAI harnesses the power of AI to empower individuals on their emotional journey. The app provides empathetic AI guidance, helping users understand and navigate their emotions with clarity and compassion. Whether you're seeking to improve mental well-being, set meaningful goals, or simply reflect on life's moments, our intuitive platform offers personalized insights and actionable advice.

We leveraged Swift's capabilities to craft a seamless frontend UI/UX design, ensuring a smooth user experience right away. Meanwhile, we built a solid API with fastAPI, allowing our frontend and backend to effortlessly communicate with each other.
Not only that, but we also used humeAI's powers to gain a deeper understanding of the sentiment behind each journal entry. This allowed us to better understand the emotional nuances of our users' experiences and offer a more empathetic and personalized response.
To further enhance the experience, we incorporated Groq low-latency inference to produce real-time guiding questions that are tailored to the unique context of each user's input. This means that the questions our users receive are skillfully constructed and intended to assist them in navigating their thoughts and emotions with greater clarity and insight.
